# Download/install
Obsidian is available from: https://obsidian.md/download
Click the download file to install.

# Run, first time
Obsidian stores all notes in a **vault**. Running for the first time Obsidian asks for a location of the vault. This can be any folder. 

# Extras
Obsidian has lots of options and extensions.
One option that I always activate is to separate non-markdown files from the markdown notes, see [[Obsidian configuration]]

Some useful extensions:
- Homepage: you can create a starter page as a kind of content list. It will provide an item on the left icon bar, that when clicked guides you to [[Home]]
- Dataview: query the vault on tags, folders, date. Select most recent. An excellent overview of the possibilities can be found here: https://obsidian.rocks/dataview-in-obsidian-a-beginners-guide/
- Chronology: add a calendar to view changes over time.
