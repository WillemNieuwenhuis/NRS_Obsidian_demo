# Attachments
Attachments are non-markdown files. They can be added by drag/drop, copy/paste or by copying the files to the vault.
The default location is the root folder of the vault.
This can be changed in **Settings** | **File & Links** | **Default location for new attachments**, where you also set the new folder, for example **_assets**.
